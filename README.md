# hello-world
New to this - let's try it!

Hi, my name is Xi.

A little bit about me - I am a senior at the National University of Singapore, majoring in Applied and Policy Economics. That said, I am a huge tech enthusiast, and have been active in the startup world for the past 4 years. I have been at Kisi, one of the world's leading cloud-based access control companies, for the past 2 years. What started out as an internship in Brooklyn, NY, has evolved into an enjoyable career. As a Strategy and Operations Analyst in the Kisi team right now, I work on analyzing data and insights that help inform startegic business decisions for the company. I love my job and the team!

Beyond tech, I am also interested in engaging with social issues and finding ways that technology can help create social impact. Having spent years in my undergraduate studies active in the social entrepreneurship scene in Singapore, I am familiar with the ecosystem, and would love to continue being engaged in the scene.

In my free time, you can find me pondering over a sudoku puzzle, reading on my Kindle, at the theater or people-watching at a cafe.
